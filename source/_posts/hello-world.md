NCT 127 continues to impress fans with their relentless energy and mature vibes in their new and first ever English single, _Highway to Heaven_. _Highway to Heaven_ was first introduced as a Korean sidetrack in NCT127's fourth EP, _We Are Superhuman_. Through their EP promotion cycle, NCT 127 has expressed their biased love for _Highway to Heaven_ in particular as _Social House_, one of the co-producers that have previously worked on _Ariana Grande_'s _Thank U, Next_ and _7 Rings_ has also helped in the making of this track.
