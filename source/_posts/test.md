After a grueling six months of waiting time, NCT DREAM has finally returned with their second single of 2019, _Fireflies_, with all six of their members! _Fireflies_ is a electro-pop track that is meant to bring hope, light, and friendship to the youth, explained by the members. 

This song came about right after being named as the _World Scout Foundation_'s first global ambassador, in collaboration with the organization.
