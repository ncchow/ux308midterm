After a grueling six months of waiting time, NCT DREAM has finally returned with their second single of 2019, _Fireflies_, with all six of their members! _Fireflies_ is a electro-pop track that is meant to bring hope, light, and friendship to the youth, explained by the members. 

This song came about right after being named as the _World Scout Foundation_'s first global ambassador, in collaboration with the organization.

Even without a official music video for _Fireflies_, one can experience the love and care NCT DREAM has put into the collaboration during their performance at the 24th World Scout Jamboree at the Summit Bechtel Reserve in West Virginia!
